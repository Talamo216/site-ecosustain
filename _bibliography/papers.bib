         on Tropical Rainforests},
  year={2024},
  volume={21},

  abstract={The conservation of tropical forests is a topic of significant
  social and ecological relevance due to their crucial role in the global
  ecosystem. Unfortunately, deforestation and degradation impact millions of
  hectares annually, requiring government or private initiatives for effective
  forest monitoring. However, identifying deforested regions in satellite
  images is challenging due to data imbalance, image resolution, low-contrast
  regions, and occlusion. Superpixel segmentation can overcome these drawbacks,
  reducing workload and preserving important image boundaries. However, most
  works for remote-sensing images do not exploit recent superpixel methods. In
  this work, we evaluate 16 superpixel methods in satellite images to support a
  deforestation detection system in tropical forests. We also assess the
  performance of superpixel methods for the target task, establishing a
  relationship with segmentation methodological evaluation. According to our
  results, ERS, GMMSP, and DISF perform best on undersegmentation error (UE),
  boundary recall (BR), and similarity between image and reconstruction from
  superpixels (SIRSs), respectively, whereas ERS has the best tradeoff with
  compactness index (CO) and Reg. In classification, SH, DISF, and ISF perform
  best on RGB, UMDA, and PCA compositions, respectively. According to our
  experiments, superpixel methods with better tradeoffs among delineation,
  homogeneity, compactness, and regularity are more suitable for identifying
  good superpixels for deforestation detection tasks.},

  social and ecological relevance due to their crucial role in the global
  ecosystem. Unfortunately, deforestation and degradation impact millions of
  hectares annually, necessitating government or private initiatives for
  effective forest monitoring. This study introduces a novel framework that
  employs the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) to select
  spectral bands from Landsat-8 satellite optical sensor, optimizing the
  representation of deforested areas. This selection guides a semantic
  segmentation architecture, DeepLabv3+, enhancing its performance.
  Experimental results revealed several band compositions that achieved
  superior balanced accuracy compared to commonly adopted combinations for
  deforestation detection, utilizing segment classification via a Support
  Vector Machine (SVM). Moreover, the optimal band compositions identified by
  the UMDA-based approach improved the performance of the DeepLabv3+
  architecture, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches compared in this study.
  The observation that a few selected bands outperform the total contradicts
  the data-driven paradigm prevalent in the deep learning field. Therefore,
  this suggests an exception to the conventional wisdom that `more is always
  better'.},

  abstract = {Conserving tropical forests is highly relevant socially and
  ecologically because of their critical role in the global ecosystem. However,
  the ongoing deforestation and degradation affect millions of hectares each
  year, necessitating government or private initiatives to ensure effective
  forest monitoring. In April 2019, a project based on Citizen Science and
  Machine Learning models called ForestEyes (FE) was launched with the aim of
  providing supplementary data to assist experts from government and non-profit
  organizations in their deforestation monitoring efforts. Recent research has
  shown that labeling FE project volunteers/citizen scientists helps tailor
  machine learning models. In this sense, we adopt the FE project to create
  different sampling strategies based on the wisdom of crowds to select the
  most suitable samples from the training set to learn an SVM technique and
  obtain better classification results in deforestation detection tasks. In our
  experiments, we can show that our strategy based on user entropy-increasing
  achieved the best classification results in the deforestation detection task
  when compared with the random sampling strategies, as well as, reducing the
  convergence time of the SVM technique.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests play a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth,
  however, they have experienced a significant reduction in vegetation cover
  due to activities such as degradation and deforestation. A recent initiative
  to monitor these areas is the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen
  science and machine learning to track changes in tropical forests. The
  project currently uses images from optical sensors to create citizen science
  campaigns. However, the presence of clouds is a limiting factor in optical
  images and can prevent the detection of deforested areas. Thus, this article
  presents a preliminary evaluation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images
  from Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 sensors, exploring their viability for
  citizen science campaigns in the context of the ForestEyes project.
  Experimental results indicate that PALSAR-2 data is more effective, as it has
  been particularly advantageous in identifying deforested areas.},

  abstract = {Microservices have become an important technology to enable the
  dynamic composition of large-scale self-adaptive systems. Although modern
  microservice ecosystems provide a variety of autonomous adaptation
  mechanisms, when focusing on the microservice itself, they can only account
  for changes in the sheer increase in workload volume. On the other hand, when
  workload patterns change, efficient treatment requires the intervention of
  DevOps experts to manually evolve the internal architecture of services.
  Given the need to quickly adapt systems to respond to changes, solely relying
  on DevOps to react to workload pattern changes becomes a bottleneck for
  future systems. To address this issue, we advance the concept of emergent
  microservices, that autonomously adapt and evolve their internal
  architectural composition to better handle changes in the pattern of incoming
  requests without human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach by exploring this novel concept in the context of a
  microservice-based Smart City platform. Editor’s note: Open Science material
