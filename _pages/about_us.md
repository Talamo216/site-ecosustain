The EcoSustain project focuses on Computing and Data Science for Sustainability and brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive experience in data science and engineering, artificial intelligence, software engineering, simulation, networks, and IoT. Additionally, the team includes experts in environmental sciences, climate change, smart irrigation, urban mobility, health, and economics. Its goal is to develop technological solutions aimed at creating public databases, software systems, machine learning models, dashboards, etc., to monitor and analyze urban and rural environments, contributing to ensuring the effective prevention, prediction, and reduction of environmental degradation processes and their impacts on health, as well as mathematical and econometric models that will serve as a basis for recommendations for evidence-based public policies.

ForestEyes - Citizen Scientists and Machine Learning Assisting Rainforest Conservation

Launched in April 2019, the ForestEyes Project aims to provide supplementary data to assist specialists
from governmental and non-profit organizations in their deforestation monitoring efforts. This project
uniquely integrates Citizen Science (CS) with Machine Learning (ML) to monitor tropical forests. The
renowned Zooniverse platform hosts the CS module, in which volunteers/ordinary citizens, classify
specific portions (segments) of satellite images into two predefined categories (forest or non-forest
areas). Next, these manual contributions are analyzed and used as training data for machine learning
techniques. Finally, different techniques are employed to automatically identify deforestation segments
in new images of an extensive forest region. This methodology based on CS and ML techniques
introduces a novel computational system compared to the existing monitoring systems for the Amazon
Forest. In the future, this proposed system may generate warning signals for the relevant authorities and
produce supplementary data for official monitoring programs.
