Global environmental challenges include deforestation, biodiversity loss, pollution, warming, and improper waste treatment. The significant advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence over the past two decades present numerous opportunities to apply these technologies to environmental protection. For instance, technologies like wireless sensor networks, the Internet of Things, drones, and data analytics can monitor the health of natural resources and contribute to automating restoration efforts. The EcoSustain project, comprised of researchers from leading Brazilian universities, seeks to create technological solutions such as software systems, communication protocols, and machine learning models to monitor and analyze ecosystems in real time, thus aiding in the prevention and mitigation of environmental degradation caused by human activities.
