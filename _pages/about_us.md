The EcoSustain project focuses on Computing and Data Science for Sustainability and brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive experience in data science and engineering, artificial intelligence, software engineering, simulation, networks, and IoT. Additionally, the team includes experts in environmental sciences, climate change, smart irrigation, urban mobility, health, and economics. Its goal is to develop technological solutions aimed at creating public databases, software systems, machine learning models, dashboards, etc., to monitor and analyze urban and rural environments, contributing to ensuring the effective prevention, prediction, and reduction of environmental degradation processes and their impacts on health, as well as mathematical and econometric models that will serve as a basis for recommendations for evidence-based public policies.


# Research Themes

<strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">ForestEyes - Citizen Scientists and Machine Learning Assisting Rainforest Conservation</strong>
<br>
Launched in April 2019, the ForestEyes Project aims to provide supplementary data to assist specialists
from governmental and non-profit organizations in their deforestation monitoring efforts. This project
uniquely integrates Citizen Science (CS) with Machine Learning (ML) to monitor tropical forests. The
renowned Zooniverse platform hosts the CS module, in which volunteers/ordinary citizens, classify
specific portions (segments) of satellite images into two predefined categories (forest or non-forest
areas). Next, these manual contributions are analyzed and used as training data for machine learning
techniques. Finally, different techniques are employed to automatically identify deforestation segments
in new images of an extensive forest region. This methodology based on CS and ML techniques
introduces a novel computational system compared to the existing monitoring systems for the Amazon
Forest. In the future, this proposed system may generate warning signals for the relevant authorities and
produce supplementary data for official monitoring programs.

<strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Smart City Applications for Sustainable Urban Mobility</strong>
<br>
The increasing use of mobile networks and Internet of Things devices enables communications
involving sensors, pedestrians, vehicles, and the wired Internet. Smart Cities and Intelligent
Transportation Systems applications leverage the data collection capabilities and the mobility of such
devices to improve the citizens' quality of life. Those applications need to address wireless networking
challenges, e.g., scalability and latency requirements. The goal of this project is to propose applications
that reduce the environmental impacts of urban activities using data collected from users without
leaking private information. The first application implements a use case tackling intelligent traffic light
control with centralized machine learning. The second application looks at using a more general strategy
based on distributed systems. The idea is to implement the traffic light control application using
federated learning and, in addition, build a framework that can be reused by other applications from
EcoSustain.
